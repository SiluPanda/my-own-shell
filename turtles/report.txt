I used execvp function to run and simple validator for giving errors.
Everytime a new command is given, it gets executed in a new child process

The valid_token function validates the commands and gives the expected result.

The signal handler handles the SIGINT signals (terminate a process).

The tokenizer fuction takes sentence (command in our case) and returns an array of strings (tokens).
